              <p>I hope you're doing okay. I've been doing some thinking, and I want to say how genuinely sorry I am for all the stuff I've put you through. I know I've messed up big time, and it hurts me to think about the pain I've caused.
                Honestly, I can't imagine my life without you in it. You're the reason I wake up in the morning with a smile, and every day without you feels like a never-ending Monday. I love you more than words can express, and I miss you every minute we're apart.
                I promise you this isn't just another empty apology. I'm working on being a better person and making sure I never hurt you like this again. I know it's going to take time to rebuild your trust, but I'm willing to put in the effort. I want us to come back stronger, together.
                I'm here for you whenever you're ready to talk, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. You mean the world to me, and I can't bear the thought of not having you by my side.</p>
